      <h2>Welcome</h2>

      <p>Welcome to Therapaws Canine Rehabilitation Centre! Therapaws opened in 2011 and features purpose-built
        facilities to ensure the safety and comfort of your dog at all times. We are conveniently located in
        Bracknell, Berkshire, and offer Hydrotherapy, Physiotherapy, Acupuncture, Myotherapy, Kinetics classes and
        Galen Natural Progression assessment and treatment plans. Our mission is to provide a unique service to our
        clients and referring vets. Above all, we work hard to ensure that all our clients are made as comfortable as
        possible, creating a relaxed environment to encourage trust from both the dog and their owner.</p>

      <p>At Therapaws we believe that hydrotherapy should be enjoyable as well as being beneficial. A qualified
        hydrotherapist is in the water with your dog at all times, and we pride ourselves in making the experience as
        much fun as possible so dogs want to come back! The warm, filtered water is tested three times a day to ensure
        safe, optimal conditions for your dog. We are a member of The Canine Hydrotherapy Association meaning that we
        work to the highest ethical and care standards in the UK, and you can be sure that the member of staff looking
        after your dog is well trained, qualified and experienced.</p>

      <p>All our treatments are a form of rehabilitation, so your dog may only receive treatment with a signed
        referral form from your veterinary surgeon. In order for us to contact your vet for approval, please complete
        our form by clicking <a href="CLIENT_FORM_rev1.pdf" target="_blank"><strong>here to download</strong></a>, the
        client registration form. Remember to sign and date the form, and return it to us either in person, fax, email
        or post. This is also required for fitness, fun and puppy swims.</p>

      <p>It is vital that we regularly communicate with your vet and alternative therapists so we can put together a
        <a href="MultiModal.pdf" target="_blank"><strong>multi-modal</strong></a>, tailor-made treatment plan for
        rehabilitation to ensure the best possible results. In addition, we work closely with a member of the British
        Veterinary Rehabilitation and Sports Medicine Association and with the Galen Therapy Centre, who provide input
        to our swimming rehabilitation plans and land exercises. A properly designed rehabilitation program can
        significantly benefit your dog's healing and recovery rate after surgery or injury, increasing the chances of
        a successful return to fitness, and will improve the quality of life for dogs suffering from chronic or
        degenerative conditions.

          <p>Therapaws has helped with my standard poodle and getting her back to correct fitness for agility. All the
            staff are fab, friendly and knowlegdable. So glad they are close to us and Pearl enjoys her tredmill. She
            now knows the routine takes herself in there and is happy to see everyone. Easy to find, plenty of parking.
